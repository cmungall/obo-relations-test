## Usage

 * -
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Everything is part of itself. Any part of any part of a thing is itself part of that thing. Two distinct things cannot be part of each other.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Occurrents are not subject to change and so parthood between occurrents holds for all the times that the part exists. Many continuants are subject to change, so parthood between continuants will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Parthood requires the part and the whole to have compatible classes: only an occurrent can be part of an occurrent; only a process can be part of a process; only a continuant can be part of a continuant; only an independent continuant can be part of an independent continuant; only an immaterial entity can be part of an immaterial entity; only a specifically dependent continuant can be part of a specifically dependent continuant; only a generically dependent continuant can be part of a generically dependent continuant. (This list is not exhaustive.)

A continuant cannot be part of an occurrent: use 'participates in'. An occurrent cannot be part of a continuant: use 'has participant'. A material entity cannot be part of an immaterial entity: use 'has location'. A specifically dependent continuant cannot be part of an independent continuant: use 'inheres in'. An independent continuant cannot be part of a specifically dependent continuant: use 'bearer of'.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Everything has itself as a part. Any part of any part of a thing is itself part of that thing. Two distinct things cannot have each other as a part.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Parthood requires the part and the whole to have compatible classes: only an occurrent have an occurrent as part; only a process can have a process as part; only a continuant can have a continuant as part; only an independent continuant can have an independent continuant as part; only a specifically dependent continuant can have a specifically dependent continuant as part; only a generically dependent continuant can have a generically dependent continuant as part. (This list is not exhaustive.)

A continuant cannot have an occurrent as part: use 'participates in'. An occurrent cannot have a continuant as part: use 'has participant'. An immaterial entity cannot have a material entity as part: use 'location of'. An independent continuant cannot have a specifically dependent continuant as part: use 'bearer of'. A specifically dependent continuant cannot have an independent continuant as part: use 'inheres in'.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000062 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000052 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A dependent inheres in its bearer at all times for which the dependent exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000053 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A bearer can have many dependents, and its dependents can exist for different periods of time, but none of its dependents can exist when the bearer does not exist.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000057 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Has_participant is a primitive instance-level relation between a process, a continuant, and a time at which the continuant participates in some way in the process. The relation obtains, for example, when this particular process of oxygen exchange across this particular alveolar membrane has_participant this particular sample of hemoglobin at this particular time.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000080 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A quality inheres in its bearer at all times for which the quality exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000081 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A role inheres in its bearer at all times for which the role exists, however the role need not be realized at all the times that the role exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000086 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A bearer can have many qualities, and its qualities can exist for different periods of time, but none of its qualities can exist when the bearer does not exist.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000087 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A bearer can have many roles, and its roles can exist for different periods of time, but none of its roles can exist when the bearer does not exist. A role need not be realized at all the times that the role exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001000 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is a very general relation. More specific relations are preferred when applicable, such as 'directly develops from'.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001001 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is a very general relation. More specific relations are preferred when applicable, such as 'directly develops into'. To avoid making statements about a future that may not come to pass, it is often better to use the backward-looking 'derives from' rather than the forward-looking 'derives into'.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001015 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Most location relations will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001018 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001018 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Containment obtains in each case between material and immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity; bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001018 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Intended meaning:
domain: material entity
range: spatial region or site (immaterial continuant)
        
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001025 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001025 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Most location relations will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002000 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A 2D boundary may have holes and gaps, but it must be a single connected entity, not an aggregate of several disconnected parts.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002000 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Although the boundary is two-dimensional, it exists in three-dimensional space and thus has a 3D shape.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002002 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A 2D boundary may have holes and gaps, but it must be a single connected entity, not an aggregate of several disconnected parts.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002002 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Although the boundary is two-dimensional, it exists in three-dimensional space and thus has a 3D shape.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002151 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to include disjointness axioms with part_of and has_part, however this is not possible in OWL2 as these are non-simple properties and hence cannot appear in a disjointness axiom
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002160 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) The original intent was to treat this as a macro that expands to 'in taxon' only ?Y - however, this is not necessary if we instead have supplemental axioms that state that each pair of sibling tax have a disjointness axiom using the 'in taxon' property - e.g.

 'in taxon' some Eukaryota DisjointWith 'in taxon' some Eubacteria
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002163 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) There are two ways to encode this as a shortcut relation. The other possibility to use an annotation assertion between two classes, and expand this to a disjointness axiom. 
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002178 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Individual ontologies should provide their own constraints on this abstract relation. For example, in the realm of anatomy this should hold between an artery and an anatomical structure
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002179 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Individual ontologies should provide their own constraints on this abstract relation. For example, in the realm of anatomy this should hold between a vein and an anatomical structure
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002204 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to be able to express the rule: if t transcribed from g, and t is a noncoding RNA and has an evolved function, then t has gene product g.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002218 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This may be obsoleted and replaced by the original 'has agent' relation
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002285 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation is intended for cases such as when we have a bone element replacing its cartilage element precursor. Currently most AOs represent this using 'develops from'. We need to decide whether 'develops from' will be generic and encompass replacement, or whether we need a new name for a generic relation that encompasses replacement and development-via-cell-lineage
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002291 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Revisit this term after coordinating with SO/SOM. The domain of this relation should be a sequence, as an instance of a DNA molecule is only expressed in the cell of which it is a part.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002295 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This property and its subproperties are being used primarily for the definition of GO developmental processes. The property hierarchy mirrors the core GO hierarchy. In future we may be able to make do with a more minimal set of properties, but due to the way GO is currently structured we require highly specific relations to avoid incorrect entailments. To avoid this, the corresponding genus terms in GO should be declared mutually disjoint.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002297 [alternative term](../../IAO/18/IAO_0000118.md) has product
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002314 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Because part_of is transitive, inheres in is a sub-relation of inheres in part of
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002322 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) An experimental relation currently used to connect a feature possessed by an organism (e.g. anatomical structure, biological process, phenotype or quality) to a habitat or environment in which that feature is well suited, adapted or provides a reproductive advantage for the organism. For example, fins to an aquatic environment. Usually this will mean that the structure is adapted for this environment, but we avoid saying this directly - primitive forms of the structure may not have evolved specifically for that environment (for example, early wings were not necessarily adapted for an aerial environment). Note also that this is a statement about the general class of structures - not every instance of a limb need confer an advantage for a terrestrial environment, e.g. if the limb is vestigial.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002326 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to say

if and only if
 exists c', p'
  c part_of c' and c' capable_of p
   and
  c capable_of p' and p' part_of p
then
 c ontributes_to p

However, this is not possible in OWL. We instead make this relation a sub-relation of the two chains, which gives us the inference in the one direction.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002434 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Considering relabeling as 'pairwise interacts with'
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002434 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation and all sub-relations can be applied to either (1) pairs of entities that are interacting at any moment of time (2) populations or species of entity whose members have the disposition to interact (3) classes whose members have the disposition to interact.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002435 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) An interaction that holds between two genetic entities (genes, alleles) through some genetic interaction (e.g. epistasis)
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002447 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Axiomatization to GO to be added later
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002455 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation is intended to be used for biotic pollination - e.g. a bee pollinating a flowering plant. Some kinds of pollination may be semibiotic - e.g. wind can have the role of pollinator. We would use a separate relation for this.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002480 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Axiomatization to GO to be added later
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002485 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) See notes for inverse relation
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002486 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is an exploratory relation. The label is taken from the FMA. It needs aligned with the neuron-specific relations such as has postsynaptic terminal in.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002503 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation is provided in order to support the use of relational qualities such as 'concentration of'; for example, the concentration of C in V is a quality that inheres in V, but pertains to C.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002504 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is a very strong relation. Often we will not have enough evidence to know for sure that there are no species within a lineage that lack the structure - loss is common in evolution. However, there are some statements we can make with confidence - no vertebrate lineage could persist without a brain or a heart. All primates are limbed. 
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002520 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) In the SO paper, this was defined as an instance-type relation
