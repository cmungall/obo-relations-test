## Usage

 * -
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001000 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This relation is taken from the RO2005 version of RO. It may be obsoleted and replaced by relations with different definitions. See also the 'develops from' family of relations.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002150 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) The label for this relation was previously connected to. I relabeled this to "continuous with". The standard notion of connectedness does not imply shared boundaries - e.g. Glasgow connected_to Edinburgh via M8; my patella connected_to my femur (via patellar-femoral joint)
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002158 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Consider obsoleting and merging with child relation, 'in homology relationship with'
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002214 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Experimental. In future there may be a formalization in which this relation is treated as a shortcut to some modal logic axiom. We may decide to obsolete this and adopt a more specific evolutionary relationship (e.g. evolved from)
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002215 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) For compatibility with BFO, this relation has a shortcut definition in which the expression "capable of some P" expands to "bearer_of (some realized_by only P)".

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002256 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) We place this under 'developmentally preceded by'. This placement should be examined in the context of reciprocal inductions[cjm]
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002258 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) In general you should not use this relation to make assertions - use one of the more specific relations below this one

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002434 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Note that this relationship type, and sub-relationship types may be redundant with process terms from other ontologies. For example, the symbiotic relationship hierarchy parallels GO. The relations are provided as a convenient shortcut. Consider using the more expressive processual form to capture your data. In the future, these relations will be linked to their cognate processes through rules.

Note that these entities are not necessarily contiguous - for example, the mereological sum of exons on a genome of a particular gene.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002533 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) An individual unit can be a molecular entity such as a base pair, or an abstract entity, such as the abstraction of a base pair.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002534 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Sequence bearers can be molecular entities, such as a portion of a DNA molecule, or they can be abstract entities, such as an entity representing all human sonic hedgehog regions of the genome with a particular DNA sequence.

It has yet to be formally aligned into an ontological framework; it's not clear what the ontological status of the "modifiers" are.
