 * *[curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md)* = The domain and range of this relation include entities such as: information-bearing macromolecules such as DNA, or regions of these molecules; abstract information entities encoded as a linear sequence including text, abstract DNA sequences; Sequence features, entities that have a sequence or sequences. Note that these entities are not necessarily contiguous - for example, the mereological sum of exons on a genome of a particular gene.
