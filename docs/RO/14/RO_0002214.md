 * *Label* = has prototype
 * *Definition* = x has prototype y if and only if x is an instance of C and y is a prototypical instance of C. For example, every instance of heart, both normal and abnormal is related by the has prototype relation to some instance of a "canonical" heart, which participates in blood circulation.
