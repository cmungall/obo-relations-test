 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = This relation is intended for cases such as when we have a bone element replacing its cartilage element precursor. Currently most AOs represent this using 'develops from'. We need to decide whether 'develops from' will be generic and encompass replacement, or whether we need a new name for a generic relation that encompasses replacement and development-via-cell-lineage
