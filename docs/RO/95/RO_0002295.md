## Class : results in developmental progression of

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002295
 * *Label* = results in developmental progression of
 * *Definition* = p results in the developmental progression of s iff p is a developmental process and s is an anatomical structure and p causes s to undergo a change in state along its natural developmental cycle, starting with its formation, through the mature structure, and ending with loss.

 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = This property and its subproperties are being used primarily for the definition of GO developmental processes. The property hierarchy mirrors the core GO hierarchy. In future we may be able to make do with a more minimal set of properties, but due to the way GO is currently structured we require highly specific relations to avoid incorrect entailments. To avoid this, the corresponding genus terms in GO should be declared mutually disjoint.
