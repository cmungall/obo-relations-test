## Class : in biological homology relationship with

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_HOM0000008
 * *Label* = in biological homology relationship with
 * *Definition* = Homology that is defined by sharing of a set of developmental constraints, caused by locally acting self-regulatory mechanisms of differentiation, between individualized parts of the phenotype. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01125-7, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.es.20.110189.000411, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HOM_0000008 ]
 * *Comment* = Applicable only to morphology. A certain degree of ambiguity is accepted between biological homology and parallelism.
