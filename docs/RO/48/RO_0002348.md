 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002348
 * *Label* = results in commitment to
 * *Definition* = The relationship linking a cell and its participation in a process that results in the transition of a cell such that is can only develop into a single cell type. The commitment of cells to specific cell fates and their capacity to differentiate into particular kinds of cells. Positional information is established through protein signals that emanate from a localized source within a cell (the initial one-cell zygote) or within a developmental field.
