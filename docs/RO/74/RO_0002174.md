## Class : dubious for taxon

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002174
 * *Label* = dubious for taxon
 * *Definition* = S dubious_for_taxon T if it is probably the case that no instances of S can be found in any instance of T.
 * *Comment* = This relation lacks a strong logical interpretation, but can be used in place of never_in_taxon where it is desirable to state that the definition of the class is too strict for the taxon under consideration, but placing a never_in_taxon link would result in a chain of inconsistencies that will take ongoing coordinated effort to resolve. Example: metencephalon in teleost
