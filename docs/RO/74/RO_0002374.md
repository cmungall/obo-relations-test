## Class : has fused element

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002374
 * *Label* = has fused element
 * *Definition* = x has_fused_element y iff: there exists some z : x has_part z, z homologous_to y, and y is a distinct element, the boundary between x and z is largely fiat
 * *Comment* = A single bone in one species may correspond to the fusion of two or more bones found as distinct elements in another. For example, tibiofibula has_fused_element tibia. A has_fused_element B does not imply that A has_part some B, rather than A has_part some B', where B' is not a subtype of B (because B is a distinct element but B' is a regional part) but has some evolutionary relationship to B.
